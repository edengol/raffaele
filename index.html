  <title>Raffaele: Italian Citizenship by Descent Chat Bot</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Raffaele</h1>
  <p>Raffaele is an experimental chat bot to help guide you through understanding if you might qualify for Italian citizenship by descent. It is built primarily for United States residents and takes into account citizenship laws in both the USA and Italy, including the 3 Oct 2024 "circolare" from The Italian Ministry of Interior which interprets the citizenship law in a way that a minor child loses their citizenship if their parent naturalizes.</p>
  <p>Before you begin, you must identify your line back to your last Italian-born ancestor ("LIBRA"), and know their birthdate and naturalization date if any. The naturalization date is found on the Oath/Certificate of Naturalization and not on the petition. Before The Cable Act of 1922 was passed on 22 September 1922, women in the United States derived their citizenship via their husband. If a woman married an American man or an American man naturalized, the wife also became an American in the eyes of the United States. The Italian government considers this an involuntary act of the wife and that the woman retained Italian citizenship which could be passed onto her children.</p>
